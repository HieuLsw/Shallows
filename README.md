**Shallows** is a generic abstraction layer over lightweight data storage and persistence. It provides a `Cache<Key, Value>` type, instances of which can be easily transformed and composed with each other. It gives you an ability to create highly sophisticated, effective and reliable caching/persistence solutions.

**Shallows** is deeply inspired by [Carlos][carlos-github-url] and [this amazing talk][composable-caches-in-swift-url] by [Brandon Kase][brandon-kase-twitter-url].

**Shallows** is a really small, component-based project, so if you need even more controllable solution â€“ build one yourself! Our source code is there to help.

## Usage

### Showcase

Using **Shallows** for two-step JSON cache (memory and disk):

```swift
let memoryJSONCache = MemoryCache<String, [String : Any]>()
let diskCache = FileSystemCache.inDirectory(.cachesDirectory, appending: "shallows-json-cache")
    .makeCache()
    .mapJSONDictionary()
let combinedCache = memoryJSONCache.combined(with: diskCache)
combinedCache.retrieve(forKey: "Higgins") { (result) in
    if let json = result.asOptional {
        print(json)
    }
}
combinedCache.set(["name": "Mark", "rating": 1], forKey: "Selby") { (result) in
    if result.isSuccess {
        print("Success!")
    }
}
```

### Guide

A main type of **Shallows** is `Cache<Key, Value>`. It's an abstract, type-erased structure which doesn't contain any logic -- it needs to be provided with one. The most basic one is `MemoryCache`:

```swift
let cache = MemoryCache<String, Int>().makeCache() // Cache<String, Int>
```

Cache instances have `retrieve` and `set` methods, which are asynhronous and fallible:

```swift
cache.retrieve(forKey: "some-key") { (result) in
    switch result {
    case .success(let value):
        print(value)
    case .failure(let error):
        print(error)
    }
}
cache.set(10, forKey: "some-key") { (result) in
    switch result {
    case .success:
        print("Value set!")
    case .failure(let error):
        print(error)
    }
}
```

#### Transforms

Keys and values can be mapped:

```swift
let stringCache = cache.mapValues(transformIn: { String($0) },
                                  transformOut: { try Int($0).unwrap() }) // Cache<String, String>
// ...
enum EnumKey : String {
    case first, second, third
}
let keyedCache: Cache<EnumKey, String> = stringCache.mapKeys({ $0.rawValue })
```

The concept of keys and values transformations is really powerful and it lies in the core of **Shallows**. For example, `FileSystemCache` provides a `Cache<String, Data>` instances, and you can easily map `Data` to something useful. For example, `UIImage`:

```swift
// FileSystemCache is a cache of String : Data
let fileSystemCache = FileSystemCache.inDirectory(.cachesDirectory, appending: "shallows-caches-1")
let imageCache = fileSystemCache.makeCache().mapValues(transformIn: { try UIImage(data: $0).unwrap() },
                                                       transformOut: { try UIImagePNGRepresentation($0).unwrap() })
```

Now you have an instance of type `Cache<String, UIImage>` which can be used to store images without much fuss.

#### Caches composition

Another core concept of **Shallows** is composition. Hitting a disk every time you request an image can be slow and inefficient. Instead, you can compose `MemoryCache` and `FileSystemCache`:

```swift
let efficient = MemoryCache<String, UIImage>().combined(with: imageCache)
```

It does several things:

1. When trying to retrieve an image, the memory cache first will be checked first, and if it doesn't contain a value, the request will be made to disk cache.
2. If disk cache stores a value, it will be pulled to memory cache and returned to a user.
3. When setting an image, it will be set both to memory and disk cache.

The huge advantage of **Shallows** is that it doesn't try to hide the actual mechanism - the behavior of your caches is perfectly clear, and still very simple to understand and easy to use. You control how many layers your cache has, how it acts and what it stores. **Shallows** is not an end-product - instead, it's a tool that will help you build exactly what you need.

--

Great things about composing caches is that in the end, you still has your `Cache<Key, Value>` instance. That means that you can recompose cache layers however you want without breaking the usage code. It also makes the code that depends on `Cache` very easy to test.

#### Read-only cache

If you don't want to expose writing to your cache, you can make it a read-only cache:

```swift
let readOnly = cache.makeReadOnly() // ReadOnlyCache<Key, Value>
```

Read-only caches can also be mapped and composed:

```swift
let immutableFileCache = FileSystemCache.inDirectory(.cachesDirectory, appending: "shallows-immutable")
    .makeCache()
    .mapString(withEncoding: .utf8)
    .makeReadOnly()
let cache = MemoryCache<String, String>()
    .combined(with: immutableFileCache)
    .makeReadOnly() // ReadOnlyCache<String, String>
```

--

There are several convenience methods defined on `Cache` with value of `Data`: `.mapString(withEncoding)`, `.mapJSON()`, `.mapJSONDictionary()`, `.mapPlist(format:)`, `.mapPlistDictionary(format:)`.

--

#### Single element cache

You can have a cache with keys `Void`. That means that you can store only one element there. **Shallows** provides a convenience `.singleKey` method to create it:

```swift
let settingsCache = FileSystemCache.inDirectory(.documentDirectory, appending: "settings")
    .makeCache()
    .mapJSONDictionary()
    .singleKey("settings") // Cache<Void, [String : Any]>
settingsCache.retrieve { (result) in
    // ...
}
```

#### Synchronous cache

Caches in **Shallows** are asynchronous by it's nature. However, in some situations (for example, when scripting or testing) it could be useful to have synchronous caches. You can make any cache synchronous by calling `.makeSyncCache()` on it:

```swift
let strings = FileSystemCache.inDirectory(.cachesDirectory, appending: "strings")
    .makeCache()
    .mapString(withEncoding: .utf8)
    .makeSyncCache() // SyncCache<String, String>
let existing = try strings.retrieve(forKey: "hello")
try strings.set(existing.uppercased(), forKey: "hello")
```

However, be careful with that: some caches may be designed to complete more than one time (for example, some caches may quickly return value stored in a local cache and then ask the server for an update). Making a cache like this synchronous will kill that functionality.

#### Mutating value for key

**Shallows** provides a convenient `.update` method on caches:

```swift
let arrays = MemoryCache<String, [Int]>()
arrays.update(forKey: "some-key", { $0.append(10) }) { (result) in
    // ...
}
```

#### Different ways of composition

Caches can be composed in different ways. If you look at the `combined` method, it actually looks like this:

```swift
public func combined<CacheType : CacheProtocol>(with cache: CacheType,
                     pullingFromBack: Bool,
                     pushingToBack: Bool) -> Cache<Key, Value> where CacheType.Key == Key, CacheType.Value == Value
```

And `pullingFromBack` and `pushingToBack` by are both `true` by default.

- "Pulling from back" means that when "back" cache will be hit and success, the retrieved value will be set to the "front" cache also.
- "Pushing to back" means that when the value is set to the "front" cache, it will also be set to the "back" cache.

You can change these flags to accomplish a behavior you want.           

### Making your own cache

To create your own caching layer, you should conform to `CacheProtocol`. That means that you should define these two methods:

```swift
func retrieve(forKey key: Key, completion: @escaping (Result<Value>) -> ())
func set(_ value: Value, forKey key: Key, completion: @escaping (Result<Void>) -> ())
```

Where `Key` and `Value` are associated types.

To use it as `Cache<Key, Value>` instance, simply call `.makeCache()` on it:

```swift
let cache = MyCache().makeCache()
```

You can also conform to a `ReadableCacheProtocol` only. That way, you only need to define a `retrieve(forKey:completion:)` method.

### Using Shallows with images in `UITableView`

You shouldn't. Technically you can, but really **Shallows** is not the best option for this task. Instead, you should use [Avenues][avenues-github-url], which is designed exactly for this. Saying more, **Shallows** and **Avenues** complement each other very well - **Shallows** can be used to cache fetched images on disk (which **Avenues** doesn't do). You can check out the [Avenues+Shallows][avenues-shallows-github-url] repo for more details.
